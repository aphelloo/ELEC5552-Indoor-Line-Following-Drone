## Overview
The UWA Aviation Labs (UWAAL) consists of staff and students dedicated to developing advanced drone systems for various applications. UWAAL is currently working on an indoor drone system designed to perform autonomous remote safety inspections within the Australian National Fabrication Facility (ANFF) laboratories. Given the confined space and lack of GPS signal for navigation, the drone will be programmed to follow a predefined path marked by a line on the floor and hover at specific locations. Additionally, the drone will be equipped with obstacle avoidance capabilities to ensure safe and efficient operations during the inspection process.
